18-500 Team F4: RiseVBT


This system presents a novel velocity-
based training system that integrates dual IMU sensors
with an iPhone camera to quantify athletic performance
by measuring bar velocity and acceleration. By fusing
this sensor data with a visualization of the traveled
bar-path, the proposed system provides a more robust
analytical framework than conventional methods in-
volving standalone sensors, thereby contributing to the
enhancement of performance monitoring and training
efficacy in strength sports.
